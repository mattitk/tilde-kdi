# The Tilde-KDI Text Editor

Tilde is a text editor for the console/terminal, which provides an intuitive
interface for people accustomed to GUI environments such as Gnome, KDE and
Windows. For example, the short-cut to copy the current selection is Control-C,
and to paste the previously copied text the short-cut Control-V can be used.
As another example, the File menu can be accessed by pressing Meta-F.

KDI is a similar project created by Matti Kauppila, but due to extreme
similarity I decided to make Tilde my dream code editor, using the ideas
from KDI editor also.

## KDI Addons by [mattitk^xug](https://github.com/mattitk)

Goal is to create a working and easy to use multi-cursor mode for each panel.
Highlightning refactor
Problems the team is facing is how to create it not messy but pretty and simple.
Smart panel sizing by only selecting target panel edges and applying up/down or left/right movement
Killing last window does not kill the editor

## Installing Tilde

There is no way to install Tilde-KDI at this point


The easiest way to install Tilde is by using the repositories from the Tilde
homepage [download section](https://os.ghalkes.nl/tilde/download.html). If there
are no binary packages provided for your distribution or hardware, you can still
build Tilde from the official releases provided there. Be aware that Tilde
depends on several support libraries, which are also provided through the
Tilde homepage.

Building from the official release is recommended over attempting to build from
the git repositories for installing Tilde. Only for development of Tilde should
the git repositories be used.

## Getting help

There are several ways to get help, should you have problems using, installing
or building Tilde:

* For online support, try the #tilde IRC channel on freenode
  ([webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=tilde)).
* Alternatively, questions, discussions etc. can be posted on the mailing list
  tilde-text-editor &lt;at&gt; googlegroups.com.
* For bug reports or feature suggestions, please file a bug in the github
  [bugtracker](https://github.com/gphalkes/tilde/issues).

## Developing Tilde

To help developing Tilde, you will need to build Tilde from the git
repositories. The repositories assume that all parts of Tilde, i.e. Tilde
itself and its support libraries, are built from the git repositories. Please
follow the steps below to build Tilde from the git repositories:

1. Install the dependencies of Tilde from the system libraries. On a typical
   Debian/Ubuntu system this would include (packages for OpenSUSE and Fedora
   have similar names):
   * flex
   * gettext
   * libacl1-dev
   * libattr1-dev
   * libgpm-dev
   * libncurses5-dev
   * libpcre2-dev
   * libtool-bin
   * libunistring-dev
   * libxcb1-dev and/or libx11-dev
   * pkg-config
   * LLnextgen (available [here](https://os.ghalkes.nl/LLnextgen/download.html))
   * clang (unless building using COMPILER=gcc)
2. Clone the repositories:
```bash
for i in makesys transcript t3shared t3window t3widget t3key t3config t3highlight tilde ; do
    git clone https://github.com/gphalkes/$i.git
done
```
3. Build all packages: `./t3shared/doall --skip-non-source --stop-on-error make -C src`

Once the build is complete, `tilde/src/.objects/edit` is the newly compiled
tilde. If the [termdebug](https://os.ghalkes.nl/termdebug.html) suite of tools
is installed, then `tilde/src/tedit` can be used to run the editor while
recording the input and output for debugging purposes.

## Other ways to contribute

* Answer questions on the IRC channel (see the [Getting help](#getting-help)
  section).
* Creating and maintaining packages for different distributions.
